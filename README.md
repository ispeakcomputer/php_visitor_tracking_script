# IP Grabber link

I saw a product on a show called "Catfish" where they unmask locations of the people doing catfishing online with a simple link. I told my girlfriend I could build that and got to work to make what you see here.

This little script I wrote tracks refering page, IP, time and user agent of visitors. 

It will make a log called mylogfile.txt in the same directory so you can then visit it from a browser.

**Before running change the redirect to something that makes sense **

It is currenlty set to www.google.com

## How does it work? 

1) First you would host the script at say www.mysite.com/grabber. There are tons of free hosts for stuff like this. Make your url look less suspicious here.
2) Get into the script and change the second to last lines URL. This is where the script will redirect to in order to.
3) Next use the 's' parameter to denote in your log where the link was posted with something like www.mysite.com/grabber?s=fb or www.mysite.com/grabber?s=twter
4) Here you may want to use a link shortener if your link looks sus before posting it.
5) Next post the link!

Just wait for your clicker to come clicking to read the log. This isn't fool proof. VPNs and ever mobile networks could cause issues here so something to keep in mind.
